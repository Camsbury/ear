#+TITLE: Ear

Just a personal project for Spotify interaction. Could be fun to analyze my music and do smarter things in bulk than you can in the client.

* Next Steps
** [ ] get audio features for ALL of my liked songs and start throwing down on some sorting and filtering and queueing
** [ ] extract this analysis into functions and playlist creation
